[Crystl Finance V3 Vaults](https://polygon.crystl.finance/vaultsV3) - Crystl Finance is a multi-chain vaulting platform. I was the lead on a team of 3 solidity developers, working in collaboration with the front-end team, the CEO and product manager, to build, test and deploy an improved version of our vaults, with some innovative features.
We also took the product through a HashEx audit, the results of which can be viewed [here](./documents/Crystl-Vaults_audit-report_1651814621605.pdf)
The repo for these vaults is unfortunately private, but on request I would be happy to share the code with interested parties.

[SMEB Non-custodial Automated Portfolio Management Dapp](https://spheron.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmUjegH2uJPHjYceU4SRtm6qrdQbommrfcLnE6jJbAro72/) - a non-custodial, automatically rebalanced, equal weighted index of SUSHI, MATIC, ETH and BTC, on the Polygon Mainnet, and using SushiSwap's BentoBox as a base. Invest USDC in order to participate in the index. Withdraw your funds at any time. (source code can be found [here](./Crystl-Vaults_audit-report_1651814621605.pdf))

Small tools built for my own DeFi activities:
[Farm Optimizer](https://richjamo.github.io/FarmOptimizer/) - a simple utility to check the value of your holdings in a particular liquidity pool
(source code can be found [here](https://github.com/RichJamo/FarmOptimizer))

[Farm Dashboard](https://richjamo.github.io/FarmDashboard/) - a simple utility to compare returns across different liquidity mining and yield farming options (under construction - source code can be found [here](https://github.com/RichJamo/FarmDashboard))

Built as part of a tutorial during my Solidity studies:
[Crypto Kitties](https://richjamo.github.io/CryptoKitties/) - inspired by the very succesful cryptokitties website, this was a project to learn about Dapp development generally, and about NFT's in particular.
