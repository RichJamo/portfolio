## Richard Jamieson

Iâ€™m an Electrical Engineer with a wide-ranging career as an investment banker, leadership consultant, entrepreneur and developer, now looking to work alongside other good, smart people in the DeFi / Blockchain space, helping to build out the ecosystem and make a dent in the world!

Below are examples of my online projects - some of them built entirely from scratch, some built as part of courses I've attended at Ivan on Tech Academy.

[Farm Optimizer](https://richjamo.github.io/FarmOptimizer/) - a simple utility to check the value of your holdings in a particular liquidity pool

[Farm Dashboard](https://richjamo.github.io/FarmDashboard/) - a simple utility to compare returns across different liquidity mining and yield farming options (under construction)

[Auto Rebalancer](https://richjamo.github.io/autoBalancer/) - a Dapp that can be used to rebalance a selection of coins using an AMM like Sushiswap (under construction)
