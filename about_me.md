title: "About Me"
permalink: /about/

Iâ€™m an Electrical Engineer with a wide-ranging career as an investment banker, leadership consultant, entrepreneur and developer, now looking to work alongside other good, smart people in the DeFi / Blockchain space, helping to build out the ecosystem.

Below are examples of my online projects - some of them built entirely from scratch, some built as part of courses I've attended at Ivan on Tech Academy. Most of my coding work is done in JavaScript and Solidity, with the HTML and CSS obviously required to build the front-end, although I definitely prefer to do as little of the front-end design as possible.
