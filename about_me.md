I am a passionate and committed Smart Contract Developer with over 3 years experience in software development for traditional finance and DeFi, and prior experience in finance, entrepreneurship, and leadership consulting / coaching. I have an excellent reputation for collaborating in team environments to ship code that meets business requirements, is secure and gas efficient.

By training Iâ€™m an Electrical Engineer, but I've had a wide-ranging career as an investment banker, leadership consultant, entrepreneur and most recently have returned to software development. I've loved coming back to this space and am now looking to work alongside other good, smart people in the DeFi / Blockchain space, helping to build out the ecosystem.

See the projects section for examples of work that I've done, both as a contractor to various DeFi protocols, some personal projects, and some completed as part of courses I've attended at the Ivan on Tech Academy. Most of my coding work is done in Solidity, JavaScript, TypeScript and Python, with some HTML and CSS obviously required to build and integrate the front-end.

Outside of work I am a father to a little girl, and when she's not keeping me busy then you'll find me either surfing, trail running, mountain biking, or just watching a good series.
