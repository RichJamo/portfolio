Crystl Finance is a multi-chain vaulting platform. I was the lead on a team of 3 solidity developers, working in collaboration with the front-end team, the CEO and product manager, to build, test and deploy an improved version of our vaults, with some innovative features.
We also took the product through a HashEx audit, the results of which can be viewed [here](./documents/Crystl-Vaults_audit-report_1651814621605.pdf)

The repo for these vaults is unfortunately private, but on request I would be happy to share the code with interested parties.
